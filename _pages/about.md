I am a research scientist on the Applied Deep Learning Research team at NVIDIA, working on large language models with a focus on building effective coding agents. Our recent work [Nemotron-CORTEXA](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/adlr/cortexa/) reached the top of the official SWE-bench leaderboard. 

I received my PhD from Caltech advised by Professor [Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/index.php){:target="\_blank"}. My PhD research interest was to apply policy learning (reinforcement/imitation learning) techniques to solve optimization problems from combinatorial and Bayesian domains. During my PhD, I interned at Google Brain working on automatic music transcription and reinforcement learning.\\
I graduated with a bachelor's degree majoring in computer science and mathematics from University of Toronto where I worked with Professor [Michael Brudno](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~brudno/public/){:target="\_blank"}, Professor [Faith Ellen](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~faith/){:target="\_blank"} and Professor [Kumar Murty](http://murty.math.toronto.edu/){:target="\_blank"}.

For an overview of my PhD research, please see my presentation. [[video](https://youtu.be/rbBvVmcAjU8)][[slide](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RITJqk7JV1_aw-Kpc8i86wUrtf-XJ3Rr)].

I helped organize the [Learning Meets Combinatorial Algorithms Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/lmca2020/home){:target="\_blain"} at NeurIPS 2020, which covered a broad range of research in learning to optimize.
