I am a research scientist at NVIDIA, working on automated software tools and algorithmic optimization.  I received my PhD from Caltech advised by Professor [Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/index.php){:target="\_blank"}. My PhD research focused on combinatorial optimization and search algorithms.
I graduated with a bachelor's degree majoring in computer science and mathematics from University of Toronto where I worked with Professor [Michael Brudno](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~brudno/public/){:target="\_blank"}, Professor [Faith Ellen](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~faith/){:target="\_blank"} and Professor [Kumar Murty](http://murty.math.toronto.edu/){:target="\_blank"}.
